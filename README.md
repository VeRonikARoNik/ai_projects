# ai_projects
AI Translators Suite repository contains two machine translation projects based on Hugging Face Transformers. The first translates Polish to English using Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-pl-en, and the second translates English to Chinese and Russian using a T5-based model. Both feature a simple CLI and support GPU acceleration.
